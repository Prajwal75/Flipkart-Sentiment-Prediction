# Sentiment Analysis Project

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis Project! This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model for analyzing sentiment in text data. The model is designed to automate the process of analyzing sentiment in text, providing valuable insights into the emotional tone of the text.

## Key Features

- **Automated Model Building:** The sentiment analysis model is built using automated pipelines, ensuring consistency and reproducibility in the model training process.
  
- **MLOps Integration:** MLOps practices are implemented to manage the machine learning lifecycle effectively. Continuous integration and delivery pipelines are set up to automate model deployment and monitoring.
  
- **Experiment Tracking with MLflow:** Model experiments are continuously tracked using MLflow, allowing easy comparison of different model versions and configurations.
  
- **Continuous Training:** The model is continuously trained every one minute to adapt to changing data patterns and improve performance over time.

## Tools Used

- **Pipelines:** Automated pipelines are used to streamline the model building process, ensuring efficient and consistent development.
  
- **MLOps:** MLOps practices are implemented to automate and streamline the machine learning lifecycle, from development to deployment and monitoring.
  
- **MLflow:** MLflow is used for experiment tracking and management, providing insights into model performance and facilitating model iteration and improvement.
